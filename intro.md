# Introduction

The life sciences study how biology orchestrates molecules to create living organisms.
An important central theme here is how the biomolecules impact life. The structure and
function of the major biomolecule classes (nucleic acids, proteins, fats, and sugars)
play a central role: the are the building blocks.

We found that how these biomolecules result in life is very structured. We found the 
evolutionary relation between DNA sequences and the similarity in proteins. We
discovered that how a protein folds up into a 3D structure is highly conserved. Not 
only does the same protein sequence strongly drive (there are exceptions) how the
protein folds up, but that proteins over many different species show similar protein
folds for similar biological roles. The latter is the foundation of, for example,
homology modelling which is used in drug discovery to study the function of proteins.

Therefore, being able to compare sequences is an extremely important tool in studying
biological systems. This material will look into why and how nucleotide changes in
DNA and RNA and amino acid changes in protein structures. Central in this topic is
that not every change has the same impact, and you will learn how biologists use that
insight when studying evolutionary aspects of DNA and protein sequences.
